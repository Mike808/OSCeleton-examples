OSCeleton
=========

What is this?
-------------

Just a couple of simple demos we created in processing to demonstrate how
to use [OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton).


How do I use it?
----------------

You first need to install avin's hacked Primesense PSDK driver for kinect:

[https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect](https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect)

Folow his instructions for installing the OpenNI framwork, the driver, and the NITE middleware.

Then go get [OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton) and
run the executable.

For both examples you need to get and install the [OscP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/).

For the stickmanetic example you additionally need to get and install
[pbox2d](http://code.google.com/p/pbox2d/).

Run the skecthes ;)


OSC Message format
------------------

Check the README on
[OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton)
and check the following method on the processing sketches:
